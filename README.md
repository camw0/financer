## Introduction

Financer is a dead simple application which I quickly built in order to have basic control, management and logging over my income.
It's written in C# using the .NET6 framework, and relies on no external packages to run.

## Using this software

Don't. This code isn't designed for use, and is moreso a demonstration of what I am currently doing in terms of learning new languages and systems.
